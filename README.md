# PronsSecDoesPhoneOsint

Welcome Yo
It sounds like someone may be calling/texting you and you have some questions..

Well here is a pretty ok tool to start that journey. You will be able to gather Region, Timezone, and (sometimes) Carrier information on that number!

Carrier info will vary, and it may often be blank. Most major carriers in the US and Europe will not be shown. But, the carriers that spammers often use WILL often have results. This generally applies to Vodafone etc.

This tool will be updated to include some more in-depth information regarding the numbers soon... but for now... enjoy!

Work from top to bottom and follow the instructions!

P.S. - Here is a test number and also the format to follow when inputting your numbers: +40721234567
